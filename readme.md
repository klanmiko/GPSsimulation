GPS Simulator
==============
GPS.m is a MATLAB script that contains an orbit simulator and GPS solver

When run, the script simulates a time step and evaluates the positions of 4 satellites and estimates the position of the target. A graph is plotted of the target and the satellites in 3D, and diagnostic information is printed to the console.

Kepler Solver
==============
kepler_orbit.m is a script that solves the kepler equation using newton's method, and then plots the solution on an ellipse defined by the user.

The script plots four graphs taken from the solution of the [kepler equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler's_equation) along fixed timesteps for one period of orbit

This project was developed in a UC Davis Seminar, Computer Simulations for STEM education
